                    <h2>Gary Marcus Was Right: One Neuroscientist's War Against the Trillion-Dollar AI Hype Machine</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gary Marcus went to war with Silicon Valley’s hype machine and never backed down. This book explains his core arguments, why they matter, and how they’ve aged.

                    <h2>Ethistates: When Geography is Dead, Values Are Everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nations used to be defined by mountains and rivers. Ethistates argues that in an age of AI, cloud infrastructure, and hyper-mobility, geography and shared heritage will matter less than shared ethics. This book explores the coming world of borderless allegiance and what it means for governance, power, and identity.

                        A deep dive into how Satya Nadella quietly rebuilt Microsoft into a trillion-dollar juggernaut. Part biography, part blueprint. It’s about culture, power, and the strange efficiency of kindness when deployed at scale.
